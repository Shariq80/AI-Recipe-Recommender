## 1. Purpose
The AI Recipe Recommender helps users transform available ingredients into personalized recipes.  
It aims to simplify meal planning, reduce food waste, and make cooking more accessible by leveraging AI.

---

## 2. Goals & Objectives
- **Primary Goal**: Enable users to input ingredients and receive a set of personalized recipe recommendations.
- **Objectives**:
  - Support manual entry of ingredients (v1).
  - Allow users to set preferences (cuisine, servings, style, number of recipe generation).
  - Generate 2–4 recipe recommendations per query.
  - Provide recipes with structured details: name, ingredients list, step-by-step instructions.

## 3. Target Audience
- Home cooks who want to use what they already have.
- Beginners who need simple, clear instructions.
- Busy professionals needing quick meal ideas.
- Foodies looking for inspiration across cuisines.

## 4. User Stories
1. *As a user, I want to enter ingredients I have, so I can discover recipes without shopping for new items.*
2. *As a user, I want to specify cuisine preference, so the recipes align with my tastes.*
3. *As a user, I want to define cooking style (e.g., healthy, comfort food), so the recipes fit my mood or diet.*
4. *As a user, I want to control servings, so I can cook just enough food.*
5. *As a user, I want multiple recipe options, so I can choose one that best fits my needs.*

## 5. Features

### Core Features (MVP)
- **Ingredient Input**: Manual entry of free-text ingredients.
- **Preference Form**: Cuisine, style text, servings, number of recipes.
- **Recipe Generation**: AI-generated recipes with name, ingredients, and instructions.
- **Results Display**: List of recipes with structured presentation.

### Nice-to-Haves (Future)
- Ingredient image upload with detection.
- Voice input for ingredients.
- Recipe saving & bookmarking.
- Dietary filters (e.g., vegan, gluten-free, keto).
- Shopping list generation.

---

## 6. Success Metrics
- **Adoption**: Number of recipe generations per user.
- **Engagement**: Avg. number of preferences filled per session.
- **Satisfaction**: Positive feedback from generated recipes (qualitative or via simple thumbs-up/down).
- **Retention**: Users returning for multiple recipe generations.

---

## 7. Constraints
- Recipes depend on the quality of LLM outputs.
- Ingredient matching is based on free text (no structured ontology in v1).
- Limited to 2–4 recipes per generation to balance quality and cost.

---

## 8. Assumptions
- Users will enter ingredients in natural language (e.g., "2 eggs, onion, salt").
- AI model can parse ambiguous terms like “to taste.”
- Users prefer a clean, minimal interface with low friction.

---

## 9. Dependencies
- **Frontend**: React app for ingredient input, preferences form, recipe display.
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express for API handling, DB persistence.
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing requests/responses.
- **AI Service**: Gemini (or similar LLM) for recipe generation.

---

## 10. Risks
- **LLM Hallucination**: AI may generate unrealistic or unsafe instructions.
- **Ingredient Handling**: Ambiguous quantities ("a handful") may cause inconsistencies.
- **Cost**: High API usage costs if traffic scales quickly.
- **Performance**: Recipe generation latency depending on LLM response times.

---

## 11. Out of Scope (v1)
- Advanced dietary restriction handling.
- Nutritional information calculation.
- Multi-language support.
- Mobile-native apps (web-only for MVP).

---

## 12. Timeline (Tentative)
- **Week 1–2**: Manual input + preferences form + API integration.
- **Week 3**: Recipe rendering + testing.
- **Week 4**: Documentation, polish, and MVP release.
